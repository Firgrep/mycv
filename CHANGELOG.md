# CHANGELOG

## 0.9 Alpha
Updates:
* Basic functionality is in place. Manual testing of the interactivity shows everything to be working as expected.

## TO DO
Immediate priority:
* Functionality for small window devices. myCV will not support small windows, but this should still be displayed somehow.
* Add header and footer for the page, perhaps a landing page along with additional information.
* Create myCV examples to use for the site and to offer the user agent some ideas and possible inspiration. 

Possible ideas for the future:
* Style buttons, radios, etc. further.
* Add a button to select font size on the template document from certain ranges. 
* Add a warning system, or a barrier, for when the user agent exceeds the document template space. 
* Add information bubbles.
