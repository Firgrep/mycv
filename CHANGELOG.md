0.9 Alpha
Updates:
* Basic functionality is in place. Manual testing of the interactivity shows everything to be working as expected.

## Future tasks
Possible ideas for the future:
* Add animation for images. 
* Style buttons, radios, etc. further.
* Add a button to select font size on the template document from certain ranges. 
* Add a warning system, or a barrier, for when the user agent exceeds the document template space. 
* Add information bubbles.
* Refactor code. Right now the bulk of the JS code is in a single file. It could be split into seperate files for easier overview, but there are tradeoffs with this as well. Alternatively, some of the main HTML element functions could be streamlined into one, but this might require a larger overhaul of the way the program is structured and keeps track of the changes. 

## Known bugs
* They are sure to come...
